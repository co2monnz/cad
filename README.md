See https://github.com/co2monnz/co2monitor-pcb for a PCB designed to fit within
the 76mm case in this repository.

The other cases/designs are for use with PCBs from the
https://github.com/oseiler2/CO2Monitor repository.

All the cases are 3D printable in PLA or PETG and have been tested to print
reliably using a Prusa i3 MK3S.
